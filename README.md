# Tabs

Tabs is an electron app than allows you to make **persistent** and **isolated** sessions on any website.

You could create `Services` for Facebook Messenger, GMail, or your personnal nextcloud instance. There is not limit to what home URL you can set.

- Services are all gathered in a single window with a simple navigation bar 
- A service can be either automatically loaded or not
- You can customize a service css (i.e. remove unwanted elements like menus or nav bars)

Tabs aims to provide both complete and simple customization.
