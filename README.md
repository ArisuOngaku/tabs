# Tabs

/!\ Still in development! I aim to improve security, usability and add more features. Wait for the 1.0 release to use tabs for critical jobs. /!\

Tabs is an electron app than allows you to make **persistent** and **isolated** sessions on any website.

You could create `Services` for Facebook Messenger, GMail, or your personnal nextcloud instance. There is not limit to what home URL you can set.

- Services are all gathered in a single window with a simple navigation bar 
- A service can be either automatically loaded or not
- You can customize a service css (i.e. remove unwanted elements like menus or nav bars)

You can navigate inside the focused service using the navigation buttons (previous page, next page).

## When's 1.0 being released?

You can track the development progress [here](https://github.com/ArisuOngaku/tabs/projects/3).
